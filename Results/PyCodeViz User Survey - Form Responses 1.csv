Timestamp,User ID,How did you like the visualization of the PyCodeViz interface?,"According to you, PyCodeViz has shown detailed information related to each execution step satisfactorily.",PyCodeViz has helped me to comprehend the code in a detailed manner.,"PyCodeViz has helped me to understand the execution of programming constructs such as iterative, conditional statements and recursive function, which helped in getting better insights about the logic of the program. ",Does PyCodeViz shows the explicit changes in the values of different variables?,I will recommend PyCodeViz to my peers.,Please suggest how we can improve the PyCodeViz?
